# Wind-Wave
Python code, R scripts, and sample data for generating video timestacks and extracting wave properties.

## About this Research
This work stems from my PhD research on wind and wave interactions, wind setup, and surface roughness on east central Florida's [Indian River Lagoon (IRL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_River_Lagoon). The scripts and data here are in support of an article entitled 'Extracting Nearshore Wave Properties from Video: A New Method for Coastal Estuaries' submitted to the journal [Estuarine, Coastal, and Shelf Science](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/estuarine-coastal-and-shelf-science) for the purpose of advancing the research and providing for scientific reproducibility.
